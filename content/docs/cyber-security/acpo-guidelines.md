# 1.12. ACPO Guidelines

## Digital Forensic Process

![Digital Forensic Process](/img/cyber-security/y1/digital-forensic-process.png)

## Before Arriving at the Scene

- Understand the nature of the investigation
    - Legal case or internal investigation
    - Technical (e.g. DoS attack, remote attack) or non-technical case (e.g. drug dealing)
    - Find out the computer skill level of the suspect
- Taking all necessary equipment
    - Write-blockers
    - Hard drive
    - Imaging devices
    - Screwdrivers
    - Gloves
    - Evidence bags
    - Evidence inventory forms
    - Video/camera with batteries
    - Storage space

## Things to do First

- Avoid evidence contamination (limiting access to scene, protective clothing)
- Identify the state of digital devices:
    - Computers: on, off, hibernate, sleep, networked?
    - Mobile devices: on, off, battery level, connected to computer?
- Locate additional evidence containers, such as USB drives, CD/DVDs, sticky notes

## Handling the Devices

- Whether the device was on or off when found, leave it in that state
- If the device was switched on:
    - Decide whether to pull the plug, shutdown via OS, perform live acquisition
    - Live acquisition:
        - Provides minimal downtime
        - Lists running processes
        - Some data is only available in RAM (encryption keys, private browsing, etc.)
    - If not handled properly, potential evidence could be contaminated or destroyed.
- If the device was switched off:
    - Take photos
    - Label cables
    - Disconnecting cables
    - Get ready for packaging

## Documentation

- Documenting the complete journey of the evidence during the life of the case to maintain the Chain of Custody
- Can be used to answer questions such as:
    - Who collected what data and when?
    - How and where?
    - Who took possession of what?
    - How was something stored and protected in storage?
    - Who took it out of storage and why?
    - When was it returned to the evidence locker and by whom?

## Storage and Transportation

- Keep electronic evidence away from magnetic sources
- Protect from extreme changes in temperature
- Use proper anti-shock material, such as bubble wrap
- Prolonged storage can result in alteration of evidence, since batteries have limited life span (like BIOS)
- Store all seized evidence in a properly secured storage area

## Rules of Evidence

- **Authentic**
    - It came from where it was supposed to
    - Evidence must be tied to the incident in order to prove something
- **Reliable and Accurate**
    - No doubt for authenticity and nothing has been contaminated
- **Complete**
    - The whole story needs to be there
- **Admissible**
    - In conformity with common law and legislative rules
- **Convincing to juries**
    - Believable and understandable

## ACPO Guidelines

Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) Crime Committee published the [Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence V5](https://www.digital-detective.net/digital-forensics-documents/ACPO_Good_Practice_Guide_for_Digital_Evidence_v5.pdf) in 2012.
